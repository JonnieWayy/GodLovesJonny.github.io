      <description>Because software changes frequently, systems, can be thought of as a set of versions, each of which has to be maintained and managed. Configuration management (CM) is concerned with the policies, processes and tools for managing changing software systems. CM Activities Change management Keeping track of requests for changes to the software from customers and developers, working out the costs and impact of changes, and deciding the changes should be</description>

      <description>Concerned with ensuring that the required level of quality is achieved in a software product. Three principal concerns: At the organizational level, quality management is concerned with establishing a framework of organizational processes and standards that will lead to high-quality software. At the project level, quality management involves the application of specific quality processes and checking that these planned processes have been followed. At the project level, quality management is</description>

      <description>Project planning involves breaking down the work into parts and assign these to project team members, anticipate problems that might arise and prepare tentative solutions to those problems. The aim of planning at this stage is to provide information that will be used in setting a price for the system to customers.

      <description>A key problem for all organizations is implementing and managing change to their existing software systems. The software evolution process Change implementation Program Evolution Dynamics Program evolution dynamics is the study of the processes of system change. After several major empirical studies, Lehman and Belady proposed that there were a number of ‘laws’ which applied to all systems as they evolved. There are sensible observations</description>

      <description>Program Testing Goals To demonstrate to the developer and the customer that the software meets its requirements. (leads to validation testing) To discover situations in which the behavior of the software is incorrect, undesirable or does not conform to its specification. (leads to defect testing) Testing can only show the presence of errors in a program. It cannot demonstrate that there are no remaining faults.

      <description>Software design and implementation activities are invariably inter-leaved. An Object-oriented Design Process Object-oriented design processes involve developing a number of different system models. They require a lot of effort for development and maintenance of these models and, for small systems, this may not be cost-effective. However, for large systems developed by different groups design models are an important communication mechanism. Common activities Define the context and modes of use of</description>

      <description>The design process for identifying the sub-systems making up a system and the framework for sub-system control and communication is architectural design, which is an early stage of the system design process. The output of this design process is a description of the software architecture. It represents the link between specification and design processes and is often carried out in parallel with some specification activities. Each architectural model only shows</description>

      <description>System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system. System modeling helps the analyst to understand the functionality of the system and models are used to communicate with customers. Unified Modeling Language (UML) The UML is the standard language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. It can be used</description>

      <description>Agile Methods Features Focus on the code rather than the design. Are based on an iterative approach to software development. Are intended to deliver working software quickly and evolve this quickly to meet changing requirements. The aim of agile methods is to reduce overheads in the software process (e.g. by limiting documentation) and to be able to respond quickly to changing requirements without excessive rework. The principles of agile methods</description>

      <description>Software Process Software processes are the activities involved in producing a software system. General Software process models: The waterfall model, Incremental development, Reuse-oriented software engineering. Waterfall model phases: Requirements analysis and definition, System and software design, Implementation and unit testing, Integration and system testing, Operation and maintenance. The main drawback of the waterfall model: the difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway. (In principle, a phase has to</description>
